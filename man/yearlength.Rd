\title{Year length associated with a model calendar}
\usage{
yearlength(time)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{A variable with an attribute named 'calendar' or a
string.  The value of the attribute should be a string denoting
the type of calendar according to the CF Metdata Conventions.}
}
\value{
The length of the year for the given calendar, in days.
If the calendar is unknown, a warning is thrown and NA is
returned.  If \code{time} is a variable without a calendar, the
default year length of 365.2425 days is returned.
}
\description{
Returns the length of year (in days) associated with a particular
calendar.  The input can be a string naming a type of calendar, or
a variable with an attribute named 'calendar' holding such a
string.
}
\details{
Climate models often use a year with a length other than the
real-world value of 365.2425 days.  In netCDF files that comply
with the CF Metadata Standard, this is recorded as the 'calendar'
attribute of the time coordinate variable.  Valid calendars are:

\tabular{ll}{
standard, gregorian: \tab 365.2425 days \cr
proleptic_gregorian: \tab 365.2425 days \cr
julian:              \tab 365.25 days   \cr
noleap, 365_day:     \tab 365 days      \cr
all_leap, 366_day:   \tab 366 days      \cr
360_day:             \tab 360 days
}

Note that although the real-world Gregorian calendar is a Julian
calendar before October 15, 1582, accounting for this change would
be challenging and would frequently run contrary to common usage,
and so this function does not do so.
