<h3>Terms of use
</h3> 
<p>Data within GEBCO's gridded data sets are subject to copyright and database right restrictions.
</p> 
<p>Providing the source material is properly credited, the reproduction of the gridded bathymetry data sets in derivative form for scientific research, environmental conservation, education or other non-commercial purposes is authorised without prior permission.
</p> 
<p>Users are encouraged to advise third parties to download the GEBCO gridded data sets from our web site rather than providing the grids to third parties themselves. This will allow GEBCO to keep statistics on how widely the GEBCO gridded data sets are used.
</p> 
<p>Users who intend to use GEBCO's gridded data for commercial purposes are kindly asked to seek our prior permission.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In the first instance, please contact BODC (enquiries@bodc.ac.uk) and include a clear statement of the purpose for which the material will be used and the manner in which it will be produced.
</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Users are asked to report any problems encountered with the data as this feedback may result in the further improvement of GEBCO's data sets.
</p> 
<h3>Attribution
</h3> 
<p>Any material reproduced from GEBCO's gridded data sets should be accompanied by appropriate attribution to the source material. Users are advised the consult the accompanying data set documentation before using the data sets.
</p> 
<p>For the GEBCO bathymetry data, this should be of the form:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Reference for the GEBCO_2014 Grid: 'The GEBCO_2014 Grid, www.gebco.net'
</li> 
<li>Reference for the GEBCO One Minute Grid: 'The GEBCO One Minute Grid, version 2.0'
</li> 
<li>For non-GEBCO material, such as the land data from the SRTM30 data set, the acknowledgement should include reference to the original source material.
</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Disclaimer
</h3> 
<p>GEBCO'S GLOBAL GRIDS SHALL NOT TO BE USED FOR NAVIGATION OR FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE INVOLVING SAFETY AT SEA.
</p> 
<p>Data used in the creation of GEBCO's gridded data sets has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable. While every effort has been made to ensure reliability within the limits of present knowledge, the accuracy and completeness of GEBCO's gridded data sets cannot be guaranteed. No responsibility can be accepted by those involved in their compilation or publication for any consequential loss or damage arising from their use.
</p> 
<p>User should be aware that GEBCO's grids are deep ocean products (based on trackline data from many different sources of varying quality and coverage) and do not include detailed bathymetry for shallow shelf waters. Even to the present day, most of the world's oceans have not been fully surveyed and, for the most part, bathymetric mapping is an interpretation based on random tracklines of data from many different sources. The quality and coverage of the data from these sources is highly variable. Although GEBCO's grids are presented at 30 arc-second and one arc-minute intervals of latitude and longitude, this does not imply that knowledge is available on sea floor depth at this resolution - the depth in most 30 arc-second squares of the world's oceans has yet to measured. Users are advised to consult the accompanying data set documentation before using the data sets.
