## Introduction

Climate models frequently exhibit bias relative to observations.  Many
models have a tendency to "run hot" or "run cold" with regard to
near-surface air temperatures, and most models suffer from the
"drizzle problem" of too much light precipitation and too little heavy
precipitation.

This vignette demonstrates how to bias-correct regional climate model
(RCM) output using Kernel Density Distribution Mapping (KDDM).

## Kernel Density Distribution Mapping

Distribution mapping is the general term for bias-correction
techniques that adjust the individual values in the model output so
that their statistical distribution matches that of observations.
These techniques include quantile mapping, simple mean & variance
adjustments, and adjustments based on fitting parametric
distributions.  Teutschbein & Seibert [-@teutschbein2012bias] show
that, of the various bias correction approaches that have been
developed, distribution mapping has the best overall performance
across multiple different metrics.  McGinnis, et
al. [-@mcginnis2015kddm] show that, of the different implementations
of distribution mapping, KDDM similarly has the best overall
performance.

KDDM non-parametrically models the distribution of the data using
kernel density estimation.  The climod package uses binned kernel
density estimation from the KernSmooth package [@kernsmooth] by
default.  It then converts the PDFs so generated into CDFs via
numerical integration using the trapezoid rule and creates a transfer
function by mapping the CDF for the model data onto the CDF for the
observational data.  When applied to model output, this transfer
function accomplishes the KDDM transformation.


## Data

This vignette uses climate model output from NARCCAP, the North
American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program [@narccap].
NARCCAP generate high-resolution output for use in climate impacts
studies by dynamically downscaling coarser global climate model (GCM)
output to the 50-km gridscale [@mearns2009narccap].  We use output
from the ECP2 RCM driven by the GFDL GCM.  See the NARCCAP website
(http://narccap.ucar.edu) for more information about the simulations.

For observational data, we use the daily 1/8-degree gridded
meteorological data from the University of Washington
[@maurer2002long].  (This dataset is sometimes referred to as the
Maurer observational dataset.)

We regrid both the model outputs and the observational datasets to a
common half-degree lat/lon grid.  We regrid the model output using the
ESMF "patch recovery" interpolation method implemented in NCL.
Because the observational data is already on a higher-resolution
lat/lon grid, we aggregate it spatially by simple averaging.

It's important to understand the spatial resolution of the data to
make sense of the output.  The following code plots elevation data
(from [@gebco]) for the state of Colorado, and overlays the boundaries
of the six half-degree gridcells used in this example.  These
gridcells are roughly centered on the city of Boulder, shown in blue.


```{r, highlight=TRUE, fig.show="hold", fig.width=7, fig.height=4.75}
library(fields)

## read in topographic data
colo <- nc_ingest("gebco-topo/GEBCO-topo-colorado.nc")

## plot elevation
cmap <- terrain.colors(100)
image.plot(colo$lon, colo$lat, colo$elevation,
	   col=cmap, asp=1, xlab="lon", ylab="lat",
	   main="Colorado elevation")

## overlay RCM gridboxes
boxlat <- c(39.5, 40.0, 40.5)
boxlon <- c(-106.0, -105.5, -105.0, -104.5)

vlat = c(rbind(boxlat, boxlat, NA))
vlon = rep(c(range(boxlon), NA), length(boxlat))

hlat = rep(c(range(boxlat), NA), length(boxlon))
hlon = c(rbind(boxlon, boxlon, NA))

lines(c(vlon,hlon), c(vlat, hlat))

## Example: Bias-Correcting Tmax

This section demonstrates how to bias-correct daily maximum
temperature (Tmax) data as described above.

### Organizing the Data

There are three datasets to work with: observational data (`obs`),
model outputs for the current climate (`cur`), and model data for the
future climate (`fut`).  In NARCCAP, the "current" period (used by
both the `cur` and `obs` datasets runs from 1970-2000, while the
future period runs 2040-2070.

There are many steps where all three datasets need to be manipulated
in the same way.  To cut down on error-prone duplication of code, we
organize the datasets into lists or vectors of three elements named
`obs`, `cur`, and `fut` and operate on them using the various apply
functions.

```{r, highlight=TRUE, fig.show="hold", fig.width=7, fig.height=4.75}
varname <- "tmax"
norm <- "zscore"     ## the type of normalization to use

indir <- "boulder-data/"
infiles <- c()
infiles["obs"] <- paste0(indir,varname,".maurer.observed.daily.common.nc")
infiles["cur"] <- paste0(indir,varname,".ECP2.gfdl-current.daily.common.nc")
infiles["fut"] <- paste0(indir,varname,".ECP2.gfdl-future.daily.common.nc")

nc <- lapply(infiles, nc_ingest)

## extract variables of interest from the netcdf objects
time <- lapply(nc,"[[","time")
indata <- lapply(nc,"[[",varname)
units <- indata$cur@units

### data structures for storage of results
outdata <- lapply(indata,"+",NA)
```

The function `nc_ingest` reads in the contents of a netcdf file and
creates variables with the same names and attributes as the netcdf
file.  Compare the output from the `ncdump` command with the in-memory
representation of the ingested data.  (Note: we pipe the output
through `sed` to skip over the global attributes.)

```{r, highlight=TRUE, results="hold", comment=NA}
command <- paste("ncdump -h", infiles["cur"], "| sed '/global/,$d'")
cat(system(command, intern=TRUE), sep="\n")
```

```{r, highlight=TRUE, results="hold", comment=NA}
print(str(nc$cur))
```

### Windowing

The seasonal variation of climate variables is typically much larger
than the bias or the climate change signal.  Therefore, we have to
perform bias-correction on only a portion of the annual cycle at a
time in order to prevent it from drowning out everything else.

Climatology studies typically operate on a monthly timescale.  That
is, they assume that the weather is approximately "the same"
(statistically speaking) within a roughly 30-day period.  We will use
the same 30-day window length in this vignette, but rather than
bias-correcting the data month-by-month, we will use a sliding
window, and correct each individual day based on the 30-day period
surrounding it.

The `cslice` function takes a vector of times and generates sets of
indexes that divide the vector up into climatological windows, each of
which contains points from a particular time of year.  The function
returns an object that can be used to extract all the values falling
within a window from any vector matching the time input.

Note that the times in the input vector do not need to be uniformly
spaced, nor do they need to have an integer number of timesteps per
year.  The `cslice` function divides the annual cycle up into
contiguous windows, finds all the times falling within each window,
and returns the corresponding indexes.  The times do need to be stored
in NetCDF-CF representation, as time elapsed since some starting
point.  The `yearlength` function is used to derive the number of days
per year from the `calendar` attribute of the time vector, if it is
defined; otherwise it defaults to the standard real-world value of
365.2425 days.

The following figure shows how temperature data can be sliced into 12
"monthly" climatological windows across multiple years.  ("Monthly" is
in scare quotes because the windows are all identically 365/12 days
long, and therefore don't strictly match the calendar months.)

```{r, highlight=TRUE, fig.show="hold", fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
x <- indata$cur[2,1,]
t <- time$cur

## Slicing for 12 equally-sized monthly windows
monthly <- cslice(t, num=12, ratio=1, names=month.abb)

## Slice vectors into climatological windows
mx <- slice(x, monthly)
mt <- slice(t, monthly)

## Plot data colored by window
par(bg="gray")
col <- topo.colors(12);
names(col) <- month.abb

xr <- c(0,365*2) + min(t)
yr <- range(x)

plot(NA, xlim=xr, ylim=yr, xlab=t@units, ylab=units, main=varname)
for(i in month.abb){
    points(mt[[i]], mx[[i]], col=col[i])
}
legend("topright", names(col), col=col, pch=1, ncol=4, cex=0.75)
```

The `cslice` function generates sets of indices for both inner and
outer windows.  The smaller inner windows are contiguous, while the
larger outer windows are allowed to overlap.  This is important for
bias correction because you need a large window to get a good estimate
of the distribution, but days near the beginning and end of a large
window are not well-represented by the overall distribution,
especially in the shoulder seasons (spring and fall).  If you use a
small window, the distribution within the window is more stationary,
but not well-sampled.  We can avoid this dilemma by using a large
outer window to develop the transfer function, and then applying it
only to the data in the small inner window. This is analogous to using
a moving average to calculate anomaly values instead of a monthly
mean.  These relationships are shown in the following figure.


```{r, highlight=TRUE, fig.show="hold", fig.width=7, fig.height=13}
## Outer slice example, continuing from above: compare normalizing
## daily data based on 30-day moving climatological window vs
## normalizing using monthly window

## day of year
doy <- t %% yearlength(t)

daily <- cslice(t, inner=1, outer=30)

dox <- slice(x, daily, outer=TRUE)
dot <- slice(t, daily, outer=TRUE)

dix <- slice(x, daily, outer=FALSE)
dit <- slice(t, daily, outer=FALSE)


par(mfrow=c(4,1))

plot(doy, x, pch=".", 
     xlab="day of year", ylab=units, main="30:1 windows at day 100")

points(dot[[100]]%%365, dox[[100]], col="blue")
points(dit[[100]]%%365, dix[[100]], col="red")
legend("bottom", c("All data","Outer window","Inner window"),
       pch=c(46,1,1), col=c("black","blue","red"))


boxplot(mx,  pch='.', boxwex=1, outline=FALSE,
	main="Monthly windows", ylab=units)
boxplot(dox, pch='.', boxwex=1, outline=FALSE, main="30-day moving windows",
        whisklty=0, boxlty=0, boxfill="gray",
	xlab="day of year", ylab=units)

daynorm <- lapply(dox, normalize)
dayanom <- unslice(daynorm, daily)

monnorm <- lapply(mx, normalize)
monanom <- unslice(monnorm, monthly)

plot(doy, dayanom-monanom, pch=".",
     main="Difference in anomalies", ylab=units, xlab="day of year")
abline(v=seq(0,365, len=13),col="gray")

```

#### Calendars

Using a sliding window of a given length is also useful for
harmonizing different calendars.  Observational data from the real
world uses the familiar Gregorian calendar, which has 365 day in a
year, except for leap years, which have 366 days.  Climate models, on
the other hand, typically use idealized calendars.  Most of them use a
365-day, or 'noleap' calendar in which every year is exactly 365 days
long, with no leap years ever.  However, there are also some climate
models that use a 360-day calendar, composed of 12 days each exactly
30 days long.

These differences are difficult to deal with if you are attempting to
establish a one-to-one correspondence between the datasets.  By
slicing the datasets into a certain number of windows per year, we can
reconcile the different calendars by aligning the windows.  The fact
that the windows may have differing numbers of days is not a problem
as long as each outer window has a large number of days in it.  In
this example, a roughly 30-day window sliced across 30 years contains
around 900 days, which is more than enough to avoid problems.


### Application of Bias-Correction

The following section shows the high-level flow of the bias-correction
procedure.  At the outermost level, we loop over gridcells, correcting
each one separately.  After extracting data for a given gridcell, we
slice it into climatological windows.  This gives us a nested list
with three outer elements (one for each dataset) each containing 360
inner elements (one for each window).  We use the `renest` function to
invert the nesting, so that we have 360 outer (window) elements that
each contain 3 inner (dataset) elements.  We apply the `biascorrect`
function (described in more detail later on) to each window, re-invert
the list nesting, and then collate the inner windows of the corrected
data back into a single timeseris for each dataset using the `unslice`
function.  Finally, we save the results for this gridcell into the
appropriate section of the storage arrays.


```{r, highlight=TRUE}
## width of moving window
mwinwidth = 30

### generate climatology moving window index arrays
### 360 ~1-day moving windows w/ 30-day outer pool
cwin <- lapply(time, cslice, outer=mwinwidth, num=360)
    
### Well-formatted NetCDF files have the time dimension varying most rapidly
nxy <- dim(indata$obs)[1:2]
nx <- nxy[1]
ny <- nxy[2]

for(x in 1:nx){
    for(y in 1:ny){
        
        ## extract data for this gridcell
        data <- lapply(indata, function(a){a[x,y,]})

        ## window data using outer window
        wind <- mapply(slice, data, cwin, MoreArgs=list(outer=TRUE), SIMPLIFY=FALSE)
        
        ## invert list nesting
        datatobc <- renest(wind)
        
        ## bias-correct each window
        fixdata <- lapply(datatobc, biascorrect, norm)

        ## re-invert the list
        bc <- renest(fixdata)
        
        ## collate inner windows back into timeseries
        result <- mapply(unslice, bc, cwin, SIMPLIFY=FALSE)
        
        ## save results in array
        for(i in names(result)){
            outdata[[i]][x,y,] <- result[[i]]
        }
    }
}
```

### Details of Bias Correction

In this section, we bias-correct data from a single slice of a single
gridcell to show the procedure in detail.


```{r, highlight=TRUE, fig.show="hold", fig.width=7, fig.height=13}
#        biascorrect <- function(bcdata, norm="zscore", dmap=FALSE, ...){
#        
#            ## normalize the three data components
#            nbcd <- lapply(bcdata, normalize, norm)
#        
#            ## construct distribution mapping
#            mapping <- distmap(nbcd$cur, nbcd$obs, ...)
#        
#            ### don't subslice yet...
#        
#            ## drop obs data
#            fixme <- nbcd[-(names(nbcd)=="obs")]
#        
#            ## apply KDDM transfer function
#            fixed <- lapply(fixme, function(x){predict(mapping, x)})
#            
#            ## denormalize bias-corrected data
#            result <- list()
#            result$obs <- bcdata$obs
#            result$cur <- denormalize(fixed$cur, match=nbcd$obs)
#            result$fut <- denormalize(fixed$fut, match=nbcd$obs, adjust=nbcd$cur)
#        
#            if(dmap){
#                result$distmap <- mapping
#            }
#            
#            copyatts(bcdata, result)
#            return(result)
#        }

```

### Saving Results to NetCDF
